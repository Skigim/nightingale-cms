### BREAKING CHANGE

- Adds new AVS import functionality to financial management workflow
- All file paths have changed, import statements need updates
- Application now requires ES6 module support

- feat(assets): implement ES6 module loading for external libraries

* Add ES6 module wrappers for Fuse.js and Day.js
* Implement async loading with proper plugin support for Day.js
* Remove script tags from index.html for ES6-managed assets
* Add write operation queue to prevent file race conditions
* Ensure external libraries load before service initialization
* Maintain backward compatibility with global window access

- Edit mode step navigation now allows free movement between steps
- External libraries now load via ES6 modules instead of script tags

- fix(assets): resolve Day.js plugin extension issue

* Add explicit plugin extension using dayjs.extend() for both plugins
* Include debugging to verify plugin availability on window object
* Fix TypeError: now.fromNow is not a function by properly registering relativeTime plugin
* Add enhanced error handling with specific warnings for missing plugins
* Verify plugin functionality with test cases after extension

This resolves the Day.js plugin loading issue where plugins were loaded as scripts but not properly
registered with the Day.js instance.

- fix(components): add toast function fallback pattern to business components

* Add robust toast fallback pattern to prevent 'window.showToast is not a function' errors
* Apply consistent fallback to CaseCreationModal, FinancialItemModal, NotesModal, and
  OrganizationsTab
* Replace direct window.showToast calls with local showToast variable that includes fallbacks
* Fallback hierarchy: window.showToast → window.NightingaleToast?.show → console.log

Components fixed:

- CaseCreationModal: 3 toast calls converted to use fallback
- FinancialItemModal: 2 toast calls converted to use fallback
- NotesModal: 3 toast calls converted and removed conditional checks
- OrganizationsTab: 3 toast calls converted to use fallback

* fix(data): add automatic legacy case migration on data load

- Add ID generation for cases with null IDs
- Convert legacy createdAt to createdDate field
- Ensure personId is string format (legacy uses numbers)
- Add required default fields for legacy cases (status, description, etc.)
- Initialize financials structure for legacy cases
- Resolve duplicate person IDs with automatic regeneration
- Call migration automatically in readFile() function

* feat: docs Added fictitious training data and migration tool.

* refactor(services): remove console logging and prune snapshots

- purge console logging across services, ui, business
- prune obsolete jest snapshots
- add placeholder in ui debugComponentLibrary
- retain unused params for forthcoming logger

* feat(services): add minimal structured logger scaffold

- namespaced get factory
- level filtering & buffering
- pluggable transports & enrichers
- no console usage; safe no-op when disabled

* feat(services): add logger transports and enrichers

- Add console transport with level-based formatting
- Add memory transport with JSON/CSV/text export capabilities
- Add session ID enricher
- Add performance enricher tracking timing and memory
- Replace silent catch in ui.js with structured logging
- Create logger quick start guide and test page
- Fix lint warnings in ui.js focus management

* fix: replace silent catch blocks with structured logging

Add NightingaleLogger calls to all catch blocks across services and business components. Use
namespace:operation format with error context and appropriate log levels. Resolves P1 audit finding:
silent error handling.

- fix: resolve handleDataUpdate hoisting error in CMS app

Move handleDataUpdate callback definition before useMemo usage to prevent temporal dead zone error.
Function now defined at line 47 before being referenced in tabProps memoization.

- feat(config): standardize editor and linting configuration

* Add comprehensive .editorconfig for consistent formatting across all editors
* Remove duplicate .prettierrc.json (keeping more detailed .prettierrc)
* Add logger implementation to TabBase.js catch block

Resolves editor formatting inconsistencies between development environments.

- feat(logger): complete logger implementation with import and initialization

* Import NightingaleLogger service in main.js
* Register logger service globally during application startup
* Initialize logger with console and memory transports
* Add logger initialization in both normal and fallback modes
* Export logger service for module compatibility

Logger implementation is now fully operational across business and UI layers.

- feat(logging): add automatic file logging and sample data structure

* Enhanced logger with file transport for automatic error logging
* Added logs/ directory with retention policy documentation
* File transport writes errors to logs/error-\*.log automatically
* Integration with File System Access API for persistent logging
* Added sample-data.json structure for development/testing
* Logger now uses setupWithFileLogging for enhanced error capture

This enables persistent error logging when users test the application, providing valuable debugging
information stored in the repository.

- refactor: simplify migration tool and add comprehensive empty schema

* Replace nightingale-data.json with comprehensive empty schema including complete field templates
* Remove anonymization complexity from migration tool
* Focus migration tool on single purpose: normalize legacy data structures
* Add caseTemplate, personTemplate, organizationTemplate for development reference

* Update messaging to clarify tool purpose for legacy data normalization

- docs: add DATA-TEMPLATES.md with current schema documentation

* Complete field definitions for Cases, People, Organizations
* SQLite migration notes with person-to-person relationships
* Status values and validation rules
* Legacy compatibility documentation

- docs: update DATA-TEMPLATES.md with case types and relationship migration notes

- style(services): improve logger code quality with const declaration and whitespace cleanup

* Change pendingWrites from let to const for better semantics
* Remove trailing whitespace throughout file
* No functional changes, purely cosmetic improvements

- docs(data): clean up field definitions and templates

* Ensure searchTerm is always treated as a string in filter operations
* Apply consistent pattern across all tab components (CasesTab, PeopleTab, OrganizationsTab)

- Manual save button no longer prominent in header
- New factory pattern standardizes Tab initialization Benefits: 35% code reduction, consistent error
  handling, reusable patterns
- Removed PersonDetailsModal component and simplified table interactions to use edit modals
  exclusively
- Replace separate FileSystemService and AutosaveService with unified AutosaveFileService

- Create new AutosaveFileService that handles both file operations and autosaving
- Eliminate service coordination complexity and timing issues
- Remove dependency injection between separate services
- Single initialization point prevents infinite loops and race conditions
