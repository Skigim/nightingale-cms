# Bank Statement LLM - Proof of Concept Design

## 🚀 Phase 1: GPT-4V Hybrid Approach (Immediate)

### Architecture

```
PDF Input → Image Extraction → GPT-4V Analysis → Structured Output
                ↓
         OCR Fallback (current system)
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **GPT-4V Integration**
   - Send bank statement images directly to GPT-4V
   - Custom prompt engineering for financial document understanding
   - Structured JSON output with confidence scores

2. **Fallback System**
   - If GPT-4V fails or confidence < threshold → use current OCR
   - Hybrid validation using both approaches
   - Learn from discrepancies to improve prompts

3. **Prompt Engineering**

```javascript
const bankStatementPrompt = `
Analyze this bank statement image and extract all transactions.
Return a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "metadata": {
    "bank_name": "string",
    "account_number": "string (last 4 digits only)",
    "statement_period": "string",
    "confidence_score": "float 0-1"
  },
  "transactions": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "description": "string",
      "amount": "float",
      "type": "debit|credit",
      "balance": "float",
      "confidence": "float 0-1"
    }
  ],
  "validation": {
    "balance_progression_valid": "boolean",
    "total_credits": "float",
    "total_debits": "float",
    "potential_errors": ["array of strings"]
  }
}

Focus on:
- Accurate amount extraction (including cents)
- Proper debit/credit classification
- Balance progression validation
- OCR error detection and correction
`;
```

## 🎯 Phase 2: Fine-tuned Model (3-6 months)

### Training Data Pipeline

```
Data Sources:
├── Public financial datasets
├── Synthetic bank statements (generated)
├── Partner bank anonymized data
├── User-corrected examples
└── OCR error pattern datasets
```

### Model Fine-tuning

```python
# Conceptual training approach
base_model = "microsoft/layoutlmv3-base"
# or "google/pix2struct-base"

training_config = {
    "task": "document_understanding",
    "domain": "financial_statements",
    "output_format": "structured_json",
    "validation_logic": "banking_rules"
}

fine_tuning_data = {
    "images": bank_statement_images,  # 10K+ samples
    "labels": structured_transactions,  # manually verified
    "augmentations": ocr_error_patterns
}
```

### Performance Targets

- **Accuracy:** 95%+ transaction extraction
- **Speed:** < 30 seconds per multi-page statement
- **Formats:** Support 50+ major bank formats
- **Error Detection:** 90%+ catch rate for OCR errors

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Custom Architecture (6-12 months)

### Specialized Components

```
Document Understanding Pipeline:
├── Layout Analysis (table detection, column identification)
├── Financial Entity Recognition (amounts, dates, descriptions)
├── Transaction Classification (debit/credit, categories)
├── Balance Validation (mathematical consistency)
├── Error Detection (OCR mistakes, missing data)
└── Confidence Scoring (per-field reliability)
```

### Multi-Modal Architecture

```python
class BankStatementProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layout_model = LayoutDetectionModel()
        self.text_model = FinancialTextModel()
        self.validation_model = BalanceValidationModel()
        self.integration_layer = StructuredOutputLayer()

    def process_statement(self, pdf_pages):
        # Extract layout and structure
        layout = self.layout_model.analyze(pdf_pages)

        # Extract and classify text
        entities = self.text_model.extract(pdf_pages, layout)

        # Validate and correct
        validated = self.validation_model.check(entities)

        # Generate structured output
        return self.integration_layer.format(validated)
```
