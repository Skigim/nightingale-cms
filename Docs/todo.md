# Nightingale CMS Todo

## üèóÔ∏è Component Extraction & Refinement (Current Priority)

### Tab Components (High Priority)

- [ ] Complete extraction of DashboardTab into dedicated business component using TabBase.js
- [ ] Replace directly embedded CasesTab and PeopleTab with dedicated business components using TabBase.js
- [ ] Test TabBase.js factory pattern with all extracted tab components
- [ ] Update component registry for new tab components

### Component Architecture Cleanup

- [ ] Create dedicated component structure to replace CaseDetailsView
- [ ] Review main file for additional logic that should be extracted
- [ ] Refactor any remaining embedded components into separate files
- [ ] Standardize all components to use proper React patterns

### Service Layer Refinement

- [ ] Verify all services work correctly in current architecture
- [ ] Test autosave service integration
- [ ] Validate component fallback patterns work consistently
- [ ] Ensure all legacy compatibility functions still work

## üß™ Testing & Validation (Before Shell Integration)

### Component Testing

- [ ] Test all UI components in isolation
- [ ] Validate component registry fallback behavior
- [ ] Test error boundaries and graceful degradation
- [ ] Verify all components work in legacy HTML pages

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test complete workflows in existing pages
- [ ] Validate data persistence across component interactions
- [ ] Test toast notifications work in all contexts
- [ ] Verify clipboard service works consistently

## üì± Polish & Quality (Current System)

### User Experience

- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Ensure all modals are mobile-friendly
- [ ] Validate touch interactions for data tables
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation

### Accessibility

- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels to components
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Validate color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management

## ÔøΩ Documentation & Organization

### Component Documentation

- [ ] Document TabBase.js factory pattern usage
- [ ] Update component integration guides
- [ ] Create examples for each UI component
- [ ] Document service layer APIs

### Code Quality

- [ ] Review and clean up any remaining TODO comments in code
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions across components
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Add proper PropTypes to all components

## üöÄ Preparation for Shell Integration (Future)

### Architecture Readiness

- [ ] Determine whether UI Layer components should be compiled into a library
- [ ] Plan module loading strategy for shell integration
- [ ] Design component registry approach for unified shell
- [ ] Plan data flow architecture for multi-module system

### Integration Planning

- [ ] Document requirements for shell service loading
- [ ] Plan navigation system architecture
- [ ] Design module switching mechanisms
- [ ] Plan global state management approach

**Note**: The index.html shell is currently a placeholder/scaffold. All functional development should focus on completing component extraction and refinement in the existing system before any shell integration work begins.
