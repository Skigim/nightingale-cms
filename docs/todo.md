# Nightingale CMS Todo

## [x] Recently Completed

### Tab Components (COMPLETED)

- [x] Complete extraction of DashboardTab - Enhanced with registry patterns and React safety
- [x] Extract CasesTab - Complete TabBase.js factory implementation with useCasesData hook
- [x] Extract PeopleTab - Full CRUD interface using TabBase.js factory with usePeopleData hook
- [x] Extract EligibilityTab - Simple placeholder component with proper registration patterns
- [x] Update component registry - All new components added to business/index.js
- [x] Create analysis document - Comprehensive analysis-embedded-components.md created

**File Impact**: Main HTML reduced from 2,454 lines to 1,646 lines (33% reduction!)

## üîç Current Testing & Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Test Recent Component Extractions

- [x] Test extracted components in browser - Verify CasesTab, PeopleTab, EligibilityTab work correctly
- [x] Check browser console for errors - Verify no JavaScript errors from component extraction
- [x] Test tab switching functionality - Ensure navigation between extracted tabs works
- [x] Validate component registry loading - Confirm all components load via registry system
- [x] Test modal functionality - Verify case creation, person creation modals work
- [x] Validate data persistence - Ensure CRUD operations still work correctly

## üèóÔ∏è Remaining Component Extraction

### Additional Components to Extract

- [x] Extract CaseDetailsView (224 lines) - Complex component with multiple dependencies
- [x] Extract SettingsModal (167 lines) - File operations and data loading interface
- [x] Extract Sidebar component (317 lines) - Navigation and state management
- [x] Review for additional embedded components - Check for remaining extraction opportunities

### Service Layer Refinement

- [ ] Verify all services work correctly in current architecture
- [ ] Test autosave service integration
- [ ] Validate component fallback patterns work consistently
- [ ] Ensure all legacy compatibility functions still work

## üß™ Testing & Validation (Before Shell Integration)

### Component Testing

- [ ] Test all UI components in isolation
- [ ] Validate component registry fallback behavior
- [ ] Test error boundaries and graceful degradation
- [ ] Verify all components work in legacy HTML pages

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test complete workflows in existing pages
- [ ] Validate data persistence across component interactions
- [ ] Test toast notifications work in all contexts
- [ ] Verify clipboard service works consistently

## üì± Polish & Quality (Current System)

### User Experience

- [ ] Test keyboard navigation across all interactive components
- [ ] Ensure consistent UI patterns (modals, forms, tables)
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements have clear focus and hover states
- [ ] Optimize component load times and perceived performance

### Accessibility

- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels to components
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Validate color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management

## ÔøΩ Documentation & Organization

### Component Documentation

- [ ] Document TabBase.js factory pattern usage
- [ ] Update component integration guides
- [ ] Create examples for each UI component
- [ ] Document service layer APIs

### Code Quality

- [ ] Review and clean up any remaining TODO comments in code
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions across components
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Add proper PropTypes to all components

## üöÄ Preparation for Shell Integration (Future)

### Architecture Readiness

- [ ] Determine whether UI Layer components should be compiled into a library
- [ ] Plan module loading strategy for shell integration
- [ ] Design component registry approach for unified shell
- [ ] Plan data flow architecture for multi-module system

### Integration Planning

- [ ] Document requirements for shell service loading
- [ ] Plan navigation system architecture
- [ ] Design module switching mechanisms
- [ ] Plan global state management approach

**Note**: The index.html shell is currently a placeholder/scaffold. All functional development should focus on completing component extraction and refinement in the existing system before any shell integration work begins.
