## Notes

- **Testing Priority**: Focus on UI component tests first, then business logic
- **Performance**: Current architecture handles expected data volumes well
- **Security**: React JSX provides good XSS protection, manual DOM updates are minimal
- **Accessibility**: Components use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
